## httpd.conf - Dummy Configuration
####
# Because httpd has been compiled with both i386 and amd64 targets
# using one configuration file would pose problems when loading
# modules. THIS FILE IS A DUMMY! Do not use it.
#
#
# How does this work then?
# - amd64/httpd.conf: Bootstrap configuration for amd64 target
# - i386/httpd.conf: Bootstrap configuration for i386 target
# - httpd.conf.d/*.conf: Shared configuration spread into smaller files for easy maintance.
# 
# You can just replace the bootstrap with your actualy configuration if you like.
# This has a few drawbacks, you need to load the correct modules from the correct directory
# modules/amd64 and modules/i386 respectively, else you will get errors when loading the
# wrong binary. So you essentially end up maintaining 2 seperate configuration files.
#
# Because the former is a mess to maintain, I opted for a minimal bootstrap configuration.
# Because mod_macro is compiled statically we can define a simple macro to replace LoadModule
# the macro is called 'LoadModule' and it will set the correct module path.
# The minimal bootstrap configuration also imports all files in httpd.conf.d/*.conf,
# all configuration can simple go into the former directory. They are read alphabetically.
# We need to replace all LoadModule statements so that they use the macro instead.
# This is easy! Example:
# LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so ==>
# Use LoadModule rewrite_module mod_rewrite.so
#
# The macro will append either 'modules/amd64/' or 'modules/i386/' to the filename.
#
#
# What's with the numbers before the configuration files?
# Basically it is to ensure the order is correct.
# 0xx: very imporant stuff, mpm loading and configuration and module loading
# 1xx: important stuff, some defaults are set here and stuff like logging, pid file, ...
# 2xx: module specific stuff
# 3xx: reserved for user configuration
# 4xx: vhosts
