This is the home folder of the 'znc' user.

When the SMF Manifest in this folder is imported it will start znc as the user znc.
Before you do this you must execute:
# znc --makeconf --datadir=/opt/obd/share/znc/service --allow-root
# chown -R znc:znc /opt/obd/share/znc/service

After this the manifest can be imported and the service started
